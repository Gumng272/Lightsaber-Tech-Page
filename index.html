            <p>The <b>Lightsaber</b>, also called a <b>laser sword</b> by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a distinctive weapon, the very image of which was bound to the mythos of the Jedi Order and their polar opposites, the Sith.</p>
            <p>The lightsaber became synonymous with the Jedi Order's values to uphold peace and justice throughout the galaxy. Despite the many conflicts with lightsaber-wielding Sith and Dark Jedi, this perception endured.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A lightsaber consisted of a blade of pure plasma emitted from the hilt and suspended in a force containment field.
                    The field contained the immense heat of the plasma, protecting the wielder, and allowed the blade to keep its shape.
                </li>

                <li>Due to the weightlessness of plasma and the strong gyroscopic effect generated by it, lightsabers required a great deal of strength and dexterity to wield, and it was extremely difficult and dangerous for the untrained to attempt to use.</li>

                <li>In the hands of an expert of the force, the lightsaber was a weapon to be greatly respected and feared. To wield a lightsaber was to demonstrate incredible skill and confidence, as well as masterful dexterity and attunement to the Force.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first lightsabers came into being when the precursor Je'Daii Order combined offworld technology with a forging ritual, learning how to "freeze" a laser beam.</p>

            <p>The extreme lack of stability that plagued the weapons early designs were gradually corrected over the ages, and the cumbersome and rarely used siege-weapons gave way to elegant and much more commonly used lightsaber.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The earliest known functional lightsaber was the First Blade, built on the planet Tython prior to the Force Wars by an unknown Je'Daii Master known only as the Weapon Master.</li>

                <li>Early lightsabers suffered from energy consumption issues, which required the user to wear a power pack. The power cable restricted the users movement and made Force-powered long-range telekinetic saber combat impossible.</li>

                <p>Lightsabers are powerful weapons, but their components are fairly simple and flexible</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hilt</b>- Consisted of a metal cylinder between 24-32cm, though the size of individual hilts varied drastically.</li>
                    <li><b>Pommel Cap</b>- Cap at the bottom of the hilt, sometimes held a backup power cell.</li>
                    <li><b>Power Cell</b>- Generated high levels of energy and was unleashed through a series of focusing lenses and energizers that converted energy into plasma.</li>
                    <li><b>Lightsaber Crystal</b>-  Projected plasma through a set of Lightsaber Crystals also known as <i>Kyber Crystals</i>, that lent the blade its properties and allowed for the adjustment of blade length and power output. The ideal number of crystals was three, though only one was required.</li>
                    <li><b>Power Insulator</b>- Installed on the hilt to protect the user from energy discharges.</li>
                    <li><b>Button</b>- Required to activate lightsaber</li>
                    <li><b>Power Adjustment Knob</b>- Sometimes installed to allow the user to vary power of the blade.</li>
                    <li><b>Discharge Energy Cell</b>- Sometimes installed to increase the power output.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>Although lightsabers were extremely powerful weapons that could cut through virtually everything, there were rare materials that could withstand a lightsaber blade, but with varying degrees of success:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cortosis</b>- A rare and expensive metal that was a popular defense against lightsabers. Purified cortosis ore had the ability to momentarily "short out" a lightsaber blade, rendering it inoperable for a brief period of time before the user could reactivate it.</li>
                    <li><b>Phrik</b>- A rare metallic compound that could withstand a lightsaber blade, although unlike cortosis, Phrik did not possess the ability to cause the blade to short out. Phrik was most notably used in the construction of the electrostaffs wielded by General Grevious's MagnaGuards.</li>
                    <li><b>Darkswords</b>- An ancient type of sword made from a special material that could parry lightsabers. Unlike cortosis, this material did not possess the ability to short out lightsabers.</li>
                    <li><b>Beskar</b>- Also known as Mandalorian Iron, was a metal found on the planet Mandalore. Beskar could be forged into several different configurations to take advantage of its exceptional light-saber resisant qualities, such as the creation of Mandalorian Armor or weapons such as the Beskad (Mandalorian Saber).</li>
                    <li><b>Force Weapon</b>- Weapons could be imbued with the power of the Force, which could then be used to parry lightsaber's blade without harm. This art was quite rare, and was largely forgotten by the Jedi during the time of the Clone Wars. Less prominent Force-groups still actively used this art, such as the <i>Witches of Dathomir</i>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Hilt Variations</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Standard</b>- Consisted of a straight hilt approximately 20 to 30 centimeters long. As it is a standard make, it has no defining features other than details on individual hilts.</li>
                    <li><b>Double-bladed</b>- Also referred to as saberstaffs, double-bladed lightsabers consisted of a single hilt that projected a blade from both ends, resulting in a deadly staff-like weapon. Many saberstaff hilts had increased length, as they consisted of two seperate lightsabers connected at the pommels.</li>
                    <li><b>Guard Shoto</b>- A variation on the standard short shoto lightsabers, guard shotos featured an elongated hilt with a secondary handle built angling 90 degrees from the main hilt. They were built to be carried by the second handle, with the blade parallel to the forearm, allowing the weapon to be easily used for blocks. Due to the defensive nature of the weapon, it was recommended that the casing be machined out of lightsaber-resistant phrik alloy.</li>
                    <li><b>Curved</b>- Curved-hilt lightsabers were of a design which featured a hilt with a built in curve. This was usually done to allow the hilt to fit better into the palm, facilitating the use of one-handed fighting styles, or to provide variable blade angle to confuse opponents.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Blade Variations</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Training Saber</b>- Essentially a regular lightsaber, only engineered with a permanent low-power setting, rather than the adjustable setting featured on standard weapons. Due to their permanent low-power setting, training lightsabers were extremely limited in the type of damage they could cause.</li>
                    <li><b>Lightdagger</b>- Also known as a lightsaber shoto, was a short lightsaber. Lightdaggers were usually used as the secondary weapon in a dual-blade combat, as the smaller blade made the weapon easier to handle. Lightdaggers were also used as a primary weapon by users who were smaller in size like Jedi Grand Master Yoda.</li>
                    <li><b>Lightclub</b>- Opposite of the lightdagger, lightclubs were massively oversized lightsabers that projected overlong blades. They were almost universally used by individuals who were overlarge stature to accommodate their size.</li>
                    <li><b>Lightwhip</b>- Exotic variations on the typical lightsaber that saw very little use. Like a lightsaber, it emitted a coherent beam of energy, but instead of a straight meter-long blade, it was several meters in length and flexible. Lightwhips were used to attack opponents at range and provide an element of surprise in combat. Despite this, lightwhips were significantly weaker than standard lightsabers, and their blades were ineffective in defense.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Combat</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lightsaber Combat</b>- was the preferred fighting method used by lightsaber wielders, many of the forms and styles being designed to compensate for the gyroscopic effect inherent in lightsabers, and take advantage of the Force-sensitivity common in most wielders. Lightsaber combat was difficult to master for many reasons, one of them is that all of the weight a lightsaber had was in its hilt, and the gyroscopic effect caused resistance to changes in motion or built up momentum so quickly than an untrained wielder could lose control of the weapon.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Rituals</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Knighting Ceremony</b>- Lightsabers were an integral part of the knighting ceremonies of the Jedi Order. During the ceremony, a Padawan would have his or her Padawan braid ritualistically severed by the presiding Jedi Master. This event would often be witnessed by many fellow Jedi, who would stand in a circle around the Padawan with their lightsabers ignited.</li>

                    <li><b>Concordance of Fealty</b>- was a Jedi tradition of entrusting one's lightsaber to a fellow Order member. This exchange represented a serious, even sacred bond—the establishment of a reciprocal, master-less learning relationship.</li>
                </ul>
